/// SoracomAPIResult represents the result of an API call, which is typically the response by the Soracom API server, but might instead be an error.
///
/// There are three basic failure modes:
/// - the API returns an error/failure
/// - the client app encountered a local error trying to access the API (e.g., network not available)
/// - the client failed to parse the response (indicating a bug in either the client or the API server)
///
/// If no error occurs, this object provides access to the response data from the API server.
///
/// This object also provides information about whether an error (of any of the types above) occurred, and provides access to the error. (A local error that causes a failure when trying to query the API is not, strictly speaking, an "API response", which is why this object is called an "API result" instead.)
